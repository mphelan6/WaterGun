    <description>This mod adds a new active item called &quot;Water Gun&quot; to the game. The item shoots many peircing tears in the direction Isaac is facing for about half a second. It does not require Isaac to stop and the tears scale off of Isaac's damage.

This is currently setup to work with the Afterbirth+ itempool. It will work with just Rebirth, however it *may* cause &quot;Breakfast&quot; to spawn slightly more often (this is how the game handles loading in an item it can't find). It also may just work completely correct.</description>
